## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/ceticdev/cs305-module5/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done and please follow my coding conventions (below).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## List conventions

Read the list formatted and raw; optimizing for readability is the goal:

  * For new header additions (eg. a topic programmers should know), use an ordered list using numbers (eg. 1. Example Topic)
  * For adding a nested list entry, use the '-' character and align each dash with the first letter of the line above it.

Thanks,
Matthew Riehm
